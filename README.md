## Installation

- Python 3.6.5 
- Pytorch 0.4.1 
- Torchvision 0.2.1
- Please refer to `requirements.txt` for the other packages with the corresponding versions.

## Preparation
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/zhangxinyu-xyz/PAST-ReID.git`
2. Prepare dataset

    a. Download datasets: [Market-1501](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EpgASQKU0RQWt3JdJ3h4WTYGBrTV9E1w), [DukeMTMC-reID](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K-2uVsLB-96EiTo44oyQCyfy20g0uTNO), [CUHK03](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I3g_FBGOYZHmJYQyOT-4VK6-xAWVKxCw)

    b. Move them to ```$PAST/data/```

    c. Insure the data folder like the following structure (otherwise you should modify the data path in ```$PAST/reid/datasets/[DATANAME].py```):
```
$PAST/data
    Market-1501-v15.09.15
        bounding_box_train
        bounding_box_test
        query
    DukeMTMC-reID
        bounding_box_train
        bounding_box_test
        query
    cuhk03-np
        detected
            bounding_box_train
            bounding_box_test
            query
```
3. Prepare initial files

    a. Download initial model: [source-M.pth.tar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xq8AYK3YNlUAbpCjW_3qqggEe1brLyWS) (trained on Market-1501), [source-D.pth.tar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QsmaURPjLeU8RCBohCMKs9bMZ1sQdfwC) (trained on DukeMTMC-reID). Move them to ```$PAST/initialization/pretrained_model/```

    b. Download initial feature: [D-M_M-t-feature.mat](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qx98CdEeHeF1s5JgC0jcrfwa4u78Q3r1) (directly transfer from DukeMTMC-reID to Market-1501), [M-D_D-t-feature.mat](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JOJlanxla8mZ5koM21J83t-46qll6X43) (directly transfer from Market-1501 to DukeMTMC-reID). Move them to ```$PAST/initialization/initial_feature/```

    c. Download initial distmat: [D-M_M-t-rerank-distmat.mat](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTkFQvHg0DvYtvFKTJQggfIyQVXMQP1f) (directly transfer from DukeMTMC-reID to Market-1501, after re-rank), [M-D_D-t-rerank-distmat.mat](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13xV6K0nZzhkWWnD-Z0yHfc3fVHKu9SOK) (directly transfer from Market-1501 to DukeMTMC-reID, after re-rank). Move them to ```$PAST/initialization/initial_distmat/```

    d. If you just want to test our method, you can download our model: [D-M_best-model.pth.tar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fPPSh-s8r--715fsGfiSHJgTcdLzZZw3) (transfer from DukeMTMC-reID to Market-1501), [M-D_best-model.pth.tar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LfvWG6EeoTDasW-GrGAT9fNJTw1DmEkE) (transfer from Market-1501 to DukeMTMC-reID). Move them to ```$PAST/best_model/```

## Train
Will be released later. Please wait.

## Test
You can simply run `test_*.sh ` file for the transferring testing process.

```
sh test_D2M.sh  ### from Duke to Market1501
sh test_M2D.sh  ### from Market1501 to Duke
```
We shall get about **78.38%/54.62%** rank-1/mAP on Market-1501 (from DukeMTMC-reID to Market-1501) and **72.35%/54.26%** rank-1/mAP on DukeMTMC-reID (from Market-1501 to DukeMTMC-reID).

## Results (rank1/mAP)
| Model | M-->D | D-->M | C-->M | C-->D |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| PCB (Direct Transfer) | 42.73(25.70) | 57.57(29.01) | 51.43(27.28) | 29.40(16.72) |
